Common questions and answers for graduate advising at the School of Computing, DePaul University.

### Q: I have submitted a Graduate Assessment Exam (GAE). How will I know the result? If I pass, which courses should I take?

After submitting your GAE, you will be notified of the result via email within 7â€“10 business days. If you do not receive a response within that timeframe, you can follow up by emailing [gaeexams@cdm.depaul.edu](mailto:gaeexams@cdm.depaul.edu).

If your GAE is approved, the department will inform you which courses you should take based on your results. Generally, these will be courses from the Introductory or Foundation Course lists in your degree requirements.

For more detailed information about the GAE, please visit the [Graduate Assessment Exams page](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/GraduateAssesmentExams.aspx).
