### Q: I have submitted a Graduate Assessment Exam (GAE). How will I know the result? If I pass, which courses should I take?

After submitting your GAE, you will be notified of the result via email within 7â€“10 business days. If you do not receive a response within that timeframe, you can follow up by emailing [gaeexams@cdm.depaul.edu](mailto:gaeexams@cdm.depaul.edu).

If your GAE is approved, the department will let you know which courses you should take based on your results.
